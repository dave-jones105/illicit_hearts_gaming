			<p>Hi! I'm Brittany, or my gamer tag illicit_hearts! Before I started streaming full time, I worked for a hand full of graphic design companies, and did some freelance
			work on the side, but after doing that for a few years I realized it wasn't what I wanted to do forever. I got into gaming when my boyfriend brought an old retired computer home from his school and gave it to me. 
			We put a cheap graphics card in it, upped the memory and storage, and I started gaming. It was a good starter, and I really enjoyed playing open world games where 
			I got to just wander around and decide when and how I wanted to follow the story line.<p>
			<p>After I played on the tired old Optiplex for awhile, my boyfriend bought parts, and built me a stronger, more capable, gaming computer. That's when I started 
			getting into more competitive FPS games. After I played more competitively for awhile, I decided I wanted to start streaming, so we built another PC more oriented towards 
			video editing so I could stream live from one, but then edit videos and content for my pages on the other computer.</p>
			<p>Now that I'm more regularly playing, streaming, and building content, I am planning on upgrading my current computer to double the ram, and get a 
			stronger, more capable, graphics card so I can stream more crisp and clear content. I would also like to upgrade so I can play more up to date games at 
			a higher FPS. I would also like to add more RGB lighting to my current streaming computer so I have more fun colors when I'm playing.</p>
