			<h4>Valorant</h4>
			<p>
				Valorant is a FPS game with multiple game modes and can be a free-for-all, or team based with 2 teams of 5, lasting for 25 rounds with the winning team having to win
				at least 13 of the rounds. It is a web based game allowing players from all over the world. This was my first FPS game, and I liked the free-for-all mode because it was 
				a good way to train your aiming. It is a free to play and free to download game.

			<h4>Runescape</h4>
			<p>
				RuneScape is an MMORPG taking placing in a mythical fantasy world loosely resembling medieval Europe. There are multiple cities and regions to explore and no main story line 
				to follow, so you are free to roam and complete quests as you like, and in an order that you choose. There are an abundance of skills to train and level up, and you can change
				what you are doing at any time. I like the freedom of movement and decisions you have in this game, and its a great game to jump into if you just want to play for a little while,
				or if you want to grind and level up a specific skill for hours on end. Make sure to secure your account, because hacking is rampant within the game and if you get banned, there 
				is no coming back.

			<h4>WarZone</h4>
			<p>
				Warzone is a free to play, free to download FPS game. The core game modes allow 150 players from around the world, and the last team standing wins. Depending on the game
				mode, you can go solo, or be on a team of 2, 3, or 4 players. Sometimes I like to play with a team, but when I want to be free to do as I like I log on as a solo player.
